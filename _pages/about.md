I am a Schmidt AI in Science Postdoctoral Fellow at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography, UCSD, where I focus on modeling sequences of earthquakes and aseismic slip (SEAS). My research aims to better understand aseismic slip patterns and their relationship to seismic events by utilizing high-performance computing (HPC) systems and machine learning.

Previously, I completed my PhD at Tel Aviv University, specializing in advanced SAR interferometry and time series analysis to study earthquake cycles and plate tectonics. During my doctoral research, I developed innovative techniques such as joint model-data discretization to improve the stability of geodetic-based slip inversions and double-difference interferometry of SAR data to obtain deformation in satellite-parallel directions. I applied these methods to study major earthquakes, including the 2019 Ridgecrest sequence, the 2023 Turkey sequence, and to model postseismic slip in northeast Japan.
