I am a PhD candidate specializing in applying advanced SAR interferometry and time series analysis to study earthquake cycles and plate tectonics. I am in my fifth(and final) year of my PhD studies at Tel Aviv University, where my research focused on developing new approaches for processing SAR data and inferring spatiotemporal fault slip from geodetic surface deformation measurements.

During my PhD, I developed techniques such as joint model-data discretization to improve the stability of geodetic-based slip inversions, and double-difference interferometry of SAR data to obtain deformation in satellite-parallel directions. I have applied these methods to study major earthquakes like the 2019 Ridgecrest sequence and model postseismic slip in northeast Japan.
